CatEyes is a Flutter web application that is used to see the Frequency and the Modulation mode of a radio that is using CatWeb.

 CatWeb is a Flutter application that is available on multi platforms that connects to a Ham Radio via its CAT port and then publishes the Frequency and Modulation mode for CatWeb to display.

## Getting Started

This Flutter web application can be run locally with `flutter run` and then selecting `chrome`. Once you are happy with the results then run `flutter build web` and copy the resulting files in build/web to your webserver.
